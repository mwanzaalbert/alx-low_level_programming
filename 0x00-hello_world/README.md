# Project: 0x00. C - Hello, World

## Description

This project contains nine scripts. Some of the scripts have been written to show the output of the different steps (i.e., ***Preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking***) involved to form an executable file from C source code.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on _Ubuntu 20.04 LTS_ using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* There should be **no errors** and **no warnings** during compilation
* You are not allowed to use `system`
* Your code should use the ***Betty style***. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* All your scripts will be tested on _Ubuntu 20.04 LTS_
* All your scripts should be exactly **two lines long** (`$ wc -l file` should print `2`)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
